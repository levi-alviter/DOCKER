My Docker commands guide

Docker run image-id -> Create and run container

Docker ps -> list containers

Docker images -> list images

Docker run -it imageTag -> 
	-i Keep STDIN open even if not attached
	-t Allocate a pseudo-TTY (Create a virtual terminal device inside the container so programs think they’re running in a real terminal)

-i -> attach the terminal even if not indicated
-t -> makes the container have a virtual terminal that is connected to our current terminal

Docker start -a container-id -> attach 
Docker start -ai container-id -> attach and being able to input in the terminal 


You can't remove a running container

docker ps -a -> list all the containers not only the ones running

docker rm container_name/id container_name/id -> remove a single or several containers at a time

docker container prune -> remove all stopped containers at once

docker rmi image-id -> remove image

You can remove images if they're not used by any container anymore, that includes stopped containers

docker image prune -> remove all unused images

docker run --rm -> Automatically remove the container when it exits

docker run -p localPort:containerPort imageId -> running the container and publishing the port and connecting it with another port in our machine

docker run -d imageId -> créate the container and run it in detach mode

docker image inspect imageId -> json with info about the image

docker cp (file or dir you want to copy) containerName:(url you want to put the info) -> copy files or dirs inside a running container

example: docker cp  dummy/. 943e634825fa:/test

docker cp dockerName:(url of the file or dir to copy) (dir you want to put the info) -> copy files or dirs from a container into our local machine

example docker cp 943e634825fa:/test dummy

docker exec -it container-id/name /bin/bash -> Access the bash of the running container

docker run --name yourOwnName image-id -> add a name to your container

images naming -> repository:tag
repository: group of posible more specialized images example node
tag: defines a specialized image within a group of images

for instance node:14 -> node image in its versión 14

docker build -t goals:1 . -> add a tag and repository to the container

docker tag old-name new-name -> renaming an image by creating a clone of the image with the new name 

docker login -> login into docker hub
docker logout -> logout docker hub

docker pull profile/image-name -> pull remote image, by default pulls the latest versión

docker run profile/image-name -> if image is not found locally, it'll go and look for it remotelly -> always takes the latest versión be careful if you need a previous version
